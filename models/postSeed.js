    title: 'D Day',
    body: 'As I sat in the Doctors waiting room, I knew what she would say. I dreaded hearing her name called. "Willow". I looked up see Dr Katheryn standing by the hallway, ready to take us back. As we sat down in her office, Willow playing with the little dollhouse nearby, she said it. "The results from the diagnostic evaluation have come back. It is Autism". As she continued, my heart sank lower and lower. Autism. Two pages of therapuetic recommendations. "Set up an IEP as soon as possible." "You have to start preparing now, for her future." "She may never be able to live fully independent." "Do you have any support at home?" I left the office that day smiling, just to keep the tears from rolling. I couldn\'t let her see me cry. Wait until you get home. Put her to bed. Then, let the flood come. My baby. My sweet, spunky, intelligent, open-hearted baby. Her life, and mine, would never be the same, and I\'m so glad it isn\'t. Normal is boring. Welcome to Our Ausome Adventure.'
